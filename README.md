Welcome to the Executable Language Grounding (XLANG) Group! We are part of the HKU NLP Group at the University of Hong Kong. XLANG focuses on transforming natural language instructions via LLMs into code or actions executable within real-world environments, including databases, web applications, and the physical world, etc. It lies at the heart of LLM-powered agents or natural language interfaces that interact with these real-world environments to facilitate human interaction with data analysis, web applications, and robotic instruction through conversation. Recent advances in Executable Language Grounding incorporate techniques such as LLM + external tools/actionable or agentic LLMs, code generation, semantic parsing, and dialog or interactive systems.
