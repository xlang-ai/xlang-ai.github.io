When envisioning the future, people have always imagined an intelligent agent capable of following human commands and performing specific tasks, significantly enhancing productivity. In recent times, with the emergence of powerful language models, this vision is accelerating. For example, in late March, OpenAI harnessed the strength of its its GPT-series language models to introduce a product: [ChatGPT Plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins), which sheds new light on LLM-powered agents (Large Language Model-powered agents).

The LLM-powered agent represents a crucial step in this burgeoning field, enabling powerful language models to take actions, use tools, execute various tasks and facilitate more intelligent interactions with humans. Our team, **XLang** **Team**, wholeheartedly believes in this promising vision and sees LLM-powered agents as a pivotal path towards the future of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Now, with great excitement, we announce our commitment to exploring and advancing the realm of LLM-powered agents. In the upcoming sections, we will elaborate on our mission, workouts, and the outlook for future endeavors. Through our mission, we aspire to humbly provide insightful perspectives on the historical trajectory of this captivating vision, pushing forward the . With this enthusiasm and determination, let us together embrace a new era of intelligent agents for the future.

## **What is XLang?**

We try to explain Executable Language Grounding, or **XLang** word by word:

- In the context of NLP (Natural Language Processing), **“Grounding”** refers to the process of converting natural language instructions into executable code or actions.
- **“Executable code or actions”** refers to the translated output of the natural language instructions that can be directly executed(performed) within a given environment. It involves generating code or actions that can interact with the environment, perform specific operations, and produce tangible results.

We hope Executable Language Grounding, i.e., XLang, can thus serve as a bridge, transforming natural language instructions into code or actions executable within real-world environments. Such environments include but are not limited to databases, web applications, and the physical world navigated by robots.

Imagine the process as the transmutation of human instructions and questions — expressed in everyday language — into machine-understandable actions and code. The machine then executes these within a specific environment, leading to changes in the state of that environment. This change is observed, results are analyzed, and a further cycle of interaction with humans is initiated.

This process expands the capabilities of the agents **far beyond those of a conventional chatbot**, allowing it to address and serve a much broader scope of tasks and applications. And we believe such process lies at the heart of AI/language agents that interact with various real-world environments via natural language and accomplish tangible tasks for us. Recent advances in Executable Language Grounding incorporate techniques such as LLM (Large Language Models) enhanced with neuro-symbolic tools, code generation or semantic parsing, and dialog or interactive systems.

In the current generation of LLMs, we can furnish our models with an assortment of neuro-symbolic tools to enhance their capabilities. Typical inputs to these models could include language from the user, a toolkit brimming with different tools, and a variety of environments. The outcome is an action or code sequence executable within the corresponding environment, often entailing the use of certain tool APIs.

The process of building such agents often demands considerable effort and collaboration from a dedicated team. This is where XLang comes into play. Our objective with XLang is to establish an open-source framework and ecosystem for building and evaluating these powerful LLM-powered agents.

## **The Motivations and Challenges behind XLang**

Our team's initial spark of excitement came when OpenAI announced the release of code interpreters and plugins. These tools represented live demonstrations of many years of our research in areas such as code generation, semantic parsing, and executable language grounding. Unfortunately, we couldn't access these tools to experiment with our ideas for improvements. This limitation prompted us to think ambitiously. What if we developed our own open-source code interpreters and plugins, or even a more general agent system and framework? This would not only benefit our team but also other research labs and companies worldwide. By sharing our work, we believe we can contribute to the growth of research and applications in this direction, allowing more people to perform exciting and interesting work on our open-source system. More specifically, by shifting the focus towards interactive and real-time demos, we can:

- iteratively add and improve the agent’s design and working logics, such as integrating more useful tools
- implement robust evaluation procedures for various LLMs (Large Language Models) in a neutral manner; while platforms like Vicuna Arena have served as valuable pioneers in this area, we strive to uncover evaluation metrics tailored specifically for agents.
- push forward the agentic model’s training and development; by incorporating comprehensive evaluations and continuously iterating the training process, we aim to uncover the shortcomings of LLMs and make iterative improvements.

In short, by setting the frameworks including a real-time demo, we can further advance the research and development of LLM-powered agents and demonstrate their potential.

All such promising directions requires a critical first step: establishing a unified system that real users can access. However, challenges are many. Setting up agent demos is not as straightforward as simply connecting a chatbox to an LLM. It requires considerable effort, both in terms of engineering and research. The agents need to interact with their corresponding environments and effect changes in those environments. The system must robustly handle all sorts of situations, appropriately manage different possible execution results, and present these outcomes in the correct manner. Ensuring the robustness and scalability of this interaction cycle is a significant challenge.

Historically, NLP (Natural Language Processing) has lacked practical system demonstrations like those found in robotics or databases, and has instead focused more on testing against static benchmarks. However, with the advent of large models, we believe the time has come to bridge this gap. Similar to the MineDojo framework in embodied AI and the ManiSkill for robotics, setting up such an agent framework necessitates long-term cooperation among many individuals. Our goal is to see the fruits of our research move step by step towards real-world applications that will, in the not-so-distant future, be used by millions.

Our XLang team of about 15 researchers and developers from various backgrounds including **NLP** (Natural Language Processing), **ML** (Machine Learning), **HCI** (Human Computer Interaction), **VIS** (Visualization), **DB** (Database), **Full-stack** development, **UI design**, and **Robotics** have been working full-time on this project since the end of March. We've invested significant effort in addressing these challenges and minimizing the gap between research and the development of real-world interactive agents. We firmly believe in the value of our work and hope our open-source project will attract more researchers, developers, and designers to contribute to this exciting direction.

## **Why Us? Our Journey**

The answer to this question is quite straightforward. Our team is deeply interested in this field, and we've always wished for agents that can help people analyze data without coding, and for more natural language-led interaction modes for webs/apps. This was the primary reason why, in March, our team decided within four days of discussing the concept, to congregate in WeWork Shenzhen and commence full-time work on the project. This dedication has continued for more than four months, and we are committed to the long-term development of this project.

Many of our team members, myself included, have been consistently drawn to research problems in this direction. Our team comprises professionals with backgrounds in HCI, DB, NLP, visualization, and ML. We have all conducted extensive work on executable language grounding for building LLM-powered AI agents, specifically natural language interfaces for data in databases and webs/apps. Our research towards this goal includes a continued focus on semantic parsing or code generation.

Throughout this process, we have maintained active collaborations with industry players like Salesforce, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google, especially in the realm of text-to-SQL. We were also among the pioneers in working with large language models for in-context learning, LLM+tool use, instruction tuning, and retrieval embeddings for LLM. Here are some of our representative works:

- [Binder (ICLR 2023)](https://lm-code-binder.github.io/) - One of the earliest works in LLM + tool use/agents. This work proposed leveraging language models to solve complex problems using code interpreters and API calls, and it proposed the concept of Toolformer and ChatGPT plugins half a year before its time.
- [Instructor Embeddings (ACL 2023 Findings)](https://instructor-embedding.github.io/) - This work presented instruction-finetuned text embeddings that outperformed OpenAI embeddings. It achieved high popularity with over 500k downloads, 1k stars, and usage in numerous projects.
- [Selective Annotation (ICLR 2023)](https://github.com/HKUNLP/icl-selective-annotation) - This work explored how annotation example selection impacts LLM’s in-context learning performance.
- Code Generation and Semantic Parsing: [DS-1000 (ICML 2023)](https://ds1000-code-gen.github.io/) and [Coder-Reviewer Reranking (ICML 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16490) introduced LLM-based methods and benchmarks for code generation. [UnifiedSKG (EMNLP 2022)](https://github.com/HKUNLP/UnifiedSKG) offered a state-of-the-art framework for over 20 structured knowledge grounding tasks~~, serving as a good summary in the direction before the ChatGPT era.~~
- [Spider(EMNLP 2018)](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider): Spider is a widely studied benchmark for complex text-to-SQL tasks, attracting submissions from top research labs and communities in NLP, HCI, VIS, PL, and DB.
- Dialog and Interactive Systems: [ICL-DST (EMNLP Findings 2022)](https://github.com/Yushi-Hu/IC-DST) demonstrated the effectiveness of LLM on dialogue state tracking tasks. Other conversational text-to-code tasks included [SParC (ACL 2019)](https://yale-lily.github.io/sparc), [CoSQL (EMNLP 2019)](https://yale-lily.github.io/cosql), and [NL2Interface (NLVIZ 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08834).

## **What's Next? The Future**

Our aim is to build XLang, an open-source ecosystem and community for LLM-powered agents. This release will just be the beginning of our XLang open-source journey. In the following months, and beyond, we will be open-sourcing several significant projects, which will include all frameworks, models, demos, code, benchmarks, and more. This has been my consistent approach during my Ph.D. in the open academic community of NLP. We hope that in these particular times in NLP, we can enable more people, rather than just a few large companies or closed start-ups, to participate. We envision these initiatives as the starting point to establish a vivid LLM-powered agents, tool use, and language grounding community, encouraging more people to contribute, develop and perform exciting research based on our work.

## **Acknowledgements**

Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude towards Google Research, Amazon AWS, and Salesforce Research. The gift funds and necessary computational resources generously provided by these awards have given us the capability and resources to implement this project. We also appreciate the invaluable advice we received throughout the process.

I also feel fortunate for the year I spent at UWNLP, which is one of the world's top institutions for NLP research. Being in Seattle, a city where so many engaged in NLP have visited or even resided for a while, was a great privilege. During my time there, I managed to catch the earliest shift towards LLM, which allowed me to experience firsthand the changes in NLP. I would like to extend my thanks to Noah Smith, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Mari Ostendorf. The idea of XLang as an executable language grounding came about from a suggestion Luke made during a meeting in his office.

Lastly, I would like to pay tribute to my late Ph.D. advisor, Dragomir Radev. Without him, it's very possible that none of what we are starting today would exist.
