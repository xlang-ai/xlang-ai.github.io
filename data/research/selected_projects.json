    "desc": "One of the earliest works in LLM + tool use/agents, simultaneously with 'ReAct' last October. We proposed the use of LLM to leverage python/sql code interpreters and various API calls (similar to functional calling) to solve complex problems. This work was, unfortunately, under-recognized and under-credited. It proposed the concept of Toolformer and ChatGPT plugins half a year before its time.",

Used in retrieval augmented language models, it achieved over 500k downloads, over 1k stars, and was used in ~500 projects in half a year.",
