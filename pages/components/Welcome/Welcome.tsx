          Welcome to the <b>Executable Language Grounding (XLANG)</b> Group! We
          are part of the <b>HKU NLP Group</b> at the University of Hong Kong.
          XLANG focuses on transforming natural language instructions (via large
          language models (LLMs)) into code or actions executable within
          real-world environments, including databases, web applications, and
          the physical world etc,. It lies at the heart of LLM-powered agents or
          natural language interfaces that interact with these real-world
          environments to facilitate human interaction with data analysis, web
          applications, and robotic instruction through conversation. Recent
          advances in Executable Language Grounding incorporate techniques such
          as LLM + external tools/actionable or agentic LLMs, code generation,
          semantic parsing, and dialog or interactive systems.
